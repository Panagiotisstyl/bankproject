## 🔍 Features

- User registration and authentication
- Single or joint account creation
- Deposit and withdraw money
- Add users to joint accounts
- Authorization for sensitive operations
- Kafka integration for logging
- Redis caching for faster responses

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Java 17**
- **Spring Boot**
- **Spring Security**
- **PostgreSQL** (via Docker)
- **Kafka** (via Docker)
- **Redis** (via Docker)
- **Docker & Docker Compose**
- **Postman** (for API testing)

## 📚 Learning Experience

This project was developed during a 2.5-month internship with guidance from colleagues. I started with zero knowledge of Spring Boot, SQL databases, or Docker — everything here was learned and applied during that short period.

I'm about to begin my second year of university, and this project served as a valuable learning journey in:

- Spring Boot & REST APIs
- SQL & entity relationships
- ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)
- Docker containers & Docker Compose
- Kafka for log streaming
- Redis for caching

## 🧩 Limitations
- No frontend is implemented, this is a backend-only project
- This project is not feature-complete, and some logic might not be perfect.
- The main goal was learning, not production-readiness.
